"""
This is the package spinsfastpy. It contains python bindings to Huffenberger's &
Wandelt's spinsfast C code. We recommend using the import statement: 
import spinsfast as sfpy.

Importing this module provides two methods, forward and backward, and one 
dictionary. Please see the individual documentation for how to use
forward and backward. 

Currently no control is provided over the generation of wigner d functions
as the code here relies on Huffenberger and Wandelt's python module api which
does not expose the required methods and arguments.

Some example code, both C and Python can be found in ./examples.
