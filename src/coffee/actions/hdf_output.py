"""This module writes the data of a timeslice to an hdf file.

The main class SimOutput uses objects of class SimOutput.SimOutputType to
actually write the data. By subclassing SimOutput.SimOutputType in the manner
specified below non - numpy array data can be stored conviently.

I think of this method as a plugin for the system. The user writes a new output
method for some kind of new data type in a sub class of SimOutputType and
'plugs' this method into the 'action' list of SimOutput.
