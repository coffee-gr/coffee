"""
The FreeData class describes the \`free data' of a system of equations.

This is a subclass of Abstract Base Class. It specifies an interface. All
classes that are used to calculate initial data or free data for a simulation
scheme are assumed to implement the methods below. In particular the object
actions.hdf_output.SimOutputType.Exact uses the exact method.

It is not, in general, needed to implement all of the following methods. What
you do implement should be determined by what additional objects interact with
your subclass of the system.System class.

This object is subclassed from abc inorder to make you think twice about what
you are doing. If your free data is sufficiently simple the code that
corresponds to free data could be included directly into system.System since
all calls to FreeData are mediated through system.System.

        The currect FreeData object assumes that the simulation is being

        this method will eventually be altered to bring it into line with the
        grid method, \`boundary_slices' which specifies the slices of the domain
        corresponding to the boundary in a mannor which is independent of
        assumptions about the number of dimensions.

        This is a poorly thought through addition to this class. The idea is

        Why is something different from left_boundary needed? I don't know.
        That's why it's poorly thought through. The bottom line is that this
        method might be removed from this class at some point.

        Originally this method was used to implement the intermediate boundary
        conditions for explicit RK routines during evolution. In order to do
        this knowledge of which intermediate step the boundary condition was
        being applied is necessary. This is the reason for the keyword

        ----------

        u : tslice.TimeSlice
