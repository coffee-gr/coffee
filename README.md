## Getting started

One needs to point the PYTHONPATH environment variable to the packages directory. Then the system code can be run with

python3.10 -O TwoDAdvection_setup.py

Note that adding a -d flag to this allows you to see a visualization during the computation. You should see a wave propagating from right to left with varying amplitude.
